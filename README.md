# weather_scraper

Simple Python3 web scraper which pulls weather data from wetter.com
using the beautiful soup (bs4) library. 

Probably not the best way to do it,
but whatever (I'm still learning).

Currently only supports the city Darmstadt.

This thing will probably be rewritten with selenium webdriver
and pandas soon.
